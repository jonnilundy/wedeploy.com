##### Clone the sample repo

To start, you will clone our sample files so you can get to know the deployment process. After the tutorial, you are free to add your own files to the folder or start from scratch with a new service. 

First, run this command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/jonnilundy/tutorial-hosting.git
```

You now have a folder called `tutorial-hosting` that contains almost all the files necessary to get your static site of the ground- besides one.
