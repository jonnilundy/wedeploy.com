#### Send an Email

Great work, your app is now live! Now let's send an email.

1. Run the app in the simulator.
2. Fill in the form (make sure you put your email in the "to" field).
3. Click submit and check your email inbox because you've got mail! ðŸ“¬

Awesome! You just deployed an app and sent an email within a few minutes! We can't wait to see what else you create with WeDeploy!
