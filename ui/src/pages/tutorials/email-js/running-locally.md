##### Running locally

WeDeploy provides a dev environment for you to run and test your app before pushing it to production. Lets get that running for this project!

In your terminal, go to `tutorial-email-js` and run `we dev`.

You can now go to `http://tutorial-email-js.wedeploy.me` in your browser and see the local deployment of your project. Any changes you make to your project folder now will automatically be deployed to this local server.
