#### Send an Email

Great work, your app is now live! Now let's send an email.

1. Go to `hosting.<your-project-id>.wedeploy.io` in your browser.
2. Fill in the form (make sure you put your email in the "to" field).
3. Click submit and check your email inbox because you've got mail! ðŸ“¬

Awesome! You just deployed an app and sent an email within a few minutes! We can't wait to see what else you create with WeDeploy!

###### <span class="icon-16-star"></span> Pro Tip

Do you have a primary UI (in this case, your Hosting Service) that you would like to be served by your project's main URL (`<your-project-id>.wedeploy.io`)? Perfect, that is extremely easy to do. Go to the settings tab of your project's console and select _hosting_ as your _Home Service_.
