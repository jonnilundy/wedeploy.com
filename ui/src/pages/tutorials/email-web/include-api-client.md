#### Include API Client

Before we can make any requests to send an email, we must connect the WeDeploy API Client.

To do this, go to `index.html` in that `hosting` directory and include this script link at the bottom of the `<body>` element:

```xml
<script src="https://cdn.wedeploy.com/api/beta/wedeploy.js"></script>
```
