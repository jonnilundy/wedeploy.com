#### It Works

Great work, your app is now live! Now let's start playing with some data.

1. Go to `hosting-<projectID>.wedeploy.sh` in your browser.
2. Type an item into the input and click _Add Item_.
3. Click _Go to item listing_ and see how your data is already populated.

Awesome! You just deployed an app and saved data within a few minutes! We can't wait to see what else you create with WeDeploy!

###### <span class="icon-16-star"></span> Pro Tip

Wanting to make a pretty url for your primary UI service without purchasing a custom domain? Perfect, you can go to the _Custom Domain_ section of your service on the Dashboard and add a custom domain that ends with `wedeploy.io` (e.g. `yourapp.wedeploy.io`).
