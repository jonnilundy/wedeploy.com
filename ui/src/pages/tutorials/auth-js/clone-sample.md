##### Cloning the sample repo

To start, you need to create a new project on your WeDeploy dashboard, if you have not already (trying to migrate this tutorial with other tutorials will result in file conflict). 

Next we will download a sample repo with the necessary files to get us started.

To download, run this command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/jonnilundy/tutorial-auth-js.git
```

**After the tutorial, you are free to push your own files or start from scratch with a new project.
