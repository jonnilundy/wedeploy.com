#### It Works

Great work, your app is now live! Now let's start playing with user sign-in.

1. Run the app in the simulator.
2. Click "Create an account" and fill in the form.
3. You are logged in!

Awesome! You just created an app and started authenticating users within a few minutes! We can't wait to see what else you create with WeDeploy!
