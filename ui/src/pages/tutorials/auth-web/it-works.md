#### It Works

Great work, your app is now live! Now let's start playing with user sign-in.

1. Go to `hosting-<projectID>.wedeploy.sh` in your browser.
2. Click "Create an account" and fill in the form.
3. You are logged in! Now try signing out and signing back in.

Awesome! You just deployed an app and started authenticating users within a few minutes! We can't wait to see what else you create with WeDeploy!

###### <span class="icon-16-star"></span> Pro Tip

Wanting to make a pretty url for your primary UI service without purchasing a custom domain? Perfect, you can go to the _Custom Domain_ section of your service on the Dashboard and add a custom domain that ends with `wedeploy.io` (e.g. `yourapp.wedeploy.io`).
