#### It Works

Great work, your app is now live! Now let's start playing with some data.

1. Run the app in the simulator.
2. Type an item into the input and click _Add Item_.
3. Click _Go to item listing_ and see how your data is already populated.

Awesome! You just created an app and saved data within a few minutes! We can't wait to see what else you create with WeDeploy!
