## Installation

In order to send/receive requests to/from WeDeploy, we need to include the JavaScript API Client. This library provides a secure and reliable communication channel with WeDeploy. We can do that by simply adding a script tag in a HTML file:

```xml
<script src="http://cdn.wedeploy.com/api/latest/wedeploy.js"></script>
```
