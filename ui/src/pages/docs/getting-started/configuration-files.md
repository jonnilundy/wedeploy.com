## Project file reference

The `project.json` file is a JSON file defining the project attributes. The default path for a `project.json` is `./project.json`.

WeDeploy uses this json file to reference to project in case it's already created. If the project does not exist, it creates a new project for you.

**Supported fields:**

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| id | Project unique id. |
| name | Project name. |
| homeContainer | Service that will be receiving the requests in the base custom domain. |
| customDomains | Custom domains used instead the domain generated by wedeploy. |

**Validations:**

**id**: The id must be unique, and you may get an error message in case someone else is already using this project id.

**customDomains**: The custom domain must be unique, and you may get an error message in case someone else is already using this custom domain.

**Usage:**

`project.json`

```application/json
{
	"id": "projectexample",
	"homeContainer": "ui",
	"customDomains": ["projectexample.wedeploy.com"]
}
```

## Service file reference

The `container.json` file is a JSON file defining the service attributes and configurations. The default path for a `container.json` is `./<service_folder>/container.json`.

WeDeploy uses this json file to reference to service in case it's already created. If the service does not exist, it creates a new service for you.

**Supported fields:**

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| id    | Service unique id. |
| type  | Service stack/image type. |
| hooks | Callbacks that should be executed in the service lifecycle. Currently allowed: `build`. |
| env | Environment variables to be exported in the service lifecycle. |
| description | Short information about the service. |

**Usage:**

`container.json`

```application/json
{
	"id": "conqueror",
	"type": "wedeploy/java",
	"description": "WeDeploy Service Example",
	"hooks": {
		"build": "./gradlew clean build installDist -x test"
	},
	"env": {
