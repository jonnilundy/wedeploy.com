## JSON files

WeDeploy uses JSON files to configure your project and services. There are three main types of configurations you can utililize:

* [**project.json**](#2) for managing project-wide variables like id and home container
* [**container.json**](#3) for managing service variables like service type and environment variables 
* [**api.json**](#4) for managing api features such as path validation, authentication, and parameters in your Data

## project.json

The `project.json` file is a JSON file defining the project attributes. The default path for a `project.json` is `./project.json`.

WeDeploy uses this JSON file to reference a project in case it's already created. If the project does not exist, it creates a new project for you.

**Supported fields:**

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| id | Project unique id. |
| name | Project name. |
| homeContainer | Service that will be receiving the requests in the base custom domain. |
| customDomains | Custom domains used instead the domain generated by wedeploy. |

**Validation:**

For `id` or `customDomains`, you must use unique values or else you will receive an error message because your value is already taken.

**Usage:**

```application/json
{
	"id": "projectexample",
	"homeContainer": "ui",
	"customDomains": ["projectexample.wedeploy.com"]
}
```

## container.json

The `container.json` file is a JSON file defining the service attributes and configurations. The default path for a `container.json` is `./<service_folder>/container.json`.

WeDeploy uses this json file to reference a service in case it's already created. If the service does not exist, it creates a new service for you.

**Supported fields:**

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| id    | Service unique id. |
| type  | Service stack/image type. |
| hooks | Callbacks that should be executed in the service lifecycle. Currently allowed: `build`. |
| env | Environment variables to be exported in the service lifecycle. |
| description | Short information about the service. |

**Usage:**

```application/json
{
	"id": "conqueror",
	"type": "wedeploy/java",
	"description": "WeDeploy Service Example",
	"hooks": {
		"build": "./gradlew clean build installDist -x test"
	},
	"env": {
		"WEDEPLOY_USER": "user"
	}
}
```

## api.json

By default WeDeploy Data service is going to use all the JSON files starting with `api-*` and also the file `api.json`.

The api JSON files define the parameters and validations of your data container. The default path for an api JSON file is `./<data_service>/api.json` and are used accroding to the ordering filesystem.

**usage:**

```application/json
[
    {
        "description": "Creates a new movie",
        "path": "/movies",
        "method": "POST",
        "parameters": {
            "title": {
                "type": "string"
            }
        },
        "data": true
    }
]
```
