##### Why did you build your music search app?

I wanted to build app for music lovers that used the power of NodeJS and AngularJS technologies. Something where people could come and search music the world's best music by artist, album, genres and much more.
 
##### Did you have any unique challenges?

I didn't have any unique challenge while deploying because the WeDeploy documentation was very good. I just needed to get to know git but that was about it. At first it was not easy to understand how to create a new project and deploy the services, but once I read [the documentation about NodeJS](/docs/other/nodejs.html), it was very clear.

**I just needed to follow a few steps and within 2 minutes, my application was live!**
 
##### What API's did you use and what was your experience using them?

I used nodeJs, AngularJs and the Spotify API for developing my Music Search app. It was awesome experience. I could quickly restart a WeDeploy server or make a certain container my default service. I also could easily access resources like logs, collaborators, and much more.
 
##### What WeDeploy services did you use?

I used NodeJs service.
 
##### In what areas should WeDeploy be improved?

Providing user access to the server CLI would be advantageous.  
 
##### What was your favorite thing about WeDeploy?

Their motto is "You build and We Deploy", which rang very true for me during my development. Itâ€™s free, reliable, and powered by an experienced and trusted [company](https://liferay.com). WeDeploy is definitely a time saving deployment and infrastructure management service.  
 
##### What's coming next for your app?

I plan to add user sign in, playlist creation, genre search, and more API integrating from other music providers. If you would like to contribute, feel free to check out my project's repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/yatinweb/boilerplate-nodejs).
